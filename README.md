# XiaoMai
This is a Group Project for my 2nd year Advance Object-Oriented Programming course. It was done with the help of two other members of the team -Jirapad Sanguanpan and Navin Jongyin. XiaoMai is built as an android application using android studio and java. For the Database system, we used  Firebase as the authenticator as well as the storage for users' data in real time.
